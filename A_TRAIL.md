# Jared Trail

*NOTE: This document is a work in progress*
*NOTE: skills thats are striked through ~~like this~~ are too advanced and belong in a future skill grouping*

------

The guide is meant to:

- serve as an example path through the vast landscape of web development skills
- provide a sense of skill dependency
- serve as a reminder of what to focus on learning while working on goals

-----

## Preface

This guide is broken up into ordered skill groups. Each skill groups builds upon the last. Ideally you should obtain each skill in a given group before moving on to the next skill group but don't worry about mastering each skill. Get a basic level of competency and then move on. You'll have plenty of opportunities to practice these skills in the challenges ahead.

The skill groupings are ordered but the skills listed within each group are not ordered. Review the skills in the group, and then use one or more of the goals to practice. As you're working remember that your focus is to acquire these skills. So as you work consider checking off these skills as you feel you've obtained them.

At the end of each project:
 - review the skills you're working on and check off the ones you feel you've acquired
 - ask your peers to help you assess how well you've obtained these skills
 - take note of the resources that helped you obtain these skills so you can help improve this guide
